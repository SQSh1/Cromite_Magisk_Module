A Magisk module that installs **Cromite WebView** (v132.0.6834.83) and sets it as the default **Android System WebView**.

This is especially useful for **rooted Android 12+ devices** looking for enhanced privacy and Chromium-based rendering improvements.

## Features

- Based on **Cromite**, a hardened fork of Bromite
- Improved **privacy** and **security**
- Lightweight and regularly updated
- System-wide WebView replacement without patching system partitions

---

2. Flash it via the **Magisk app** or **custom recovery (TWRP)**.

## Updates

This module uses a built-in `update.json` to support **automatic update checks** via the Magisk app.

---

## Notes

- This module **does not modify system files permanently**, so it is relatively safe to uninstall.
- Make sure to **clear cache/data of apps that rely on WebView** after installation if you notice loading issues.
- If you face **boot issues**, uninstall via TWRP as described in the disclaimer above.
